[ ] Keep only local configuration (for now)  
[ ] Remove SSH connectivity (or keep it to another branch)  
[ ] Create a folder tree hierarchy that could be like this 
```
alphadub
    |__ user1
          |__ JOB1
          |__ JOB2
    |__ user2
          |__ JOB1
```
[ ] Create a parsing system for jobs in the tab "result".
